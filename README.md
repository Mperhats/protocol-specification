# The Universal Transaction Protocol (UTP)
UTP is a shared set of communication standards for commercial transactions. UTP is an industry-agnostic, interoperable, open protocol connecting any buyer and any seller across any industry to engage in permissionless, location-aware transactions. 

## Developers
The UTP specification defines a standard, technology-agnostic API description that allows any application to discover new commercial services without requiring api keys, source code access, additional documentation, or integrations with ad-hoc services. When properly defined, a software application can interpret and transact with remote services with a very minimal amount of implementation overhead.

Developers can use UTP to build new consumer marketplace applications without having to think about acquiring customers, hiring a sales team, or talking to a sales rep to acquire access to necessary infrastructure.

## UTP - Core Specification
Every comprehensive commercial transaction follows the same standard series of 
order lifecycle API requests. UTP defines these as follows:

### Communication

All communication throughout order lifecycle APIs follow the below structure:

| Field      | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `context`  | Contains header information used for packet switching, key lookup, and encryption |
| `message`  | Contains information pertaining to the intended transaction |

#### Discovery API
This is the stage where a Buyer searches or explores the 
product(s) or service(s) they intend to purchase from a Seller. 

The Buyers intent is typically defined by a Client application performing a 
specific function, like food delivery. The Explore API enables a Buyer to 
query the network with their Intent. The Explore API has a callback mechanism 
that returns a Catalog which includes a selection of Sellers offering the 
intended product(s) or service(s). 

The discovery process requires both a query to the registry contract and an 
API request to at least 1 server.

#### Order API 
This is the stage where the Buyer creates an order for the 
selected product(s) or service(s). The Buyer selects the Item(s) and/or Offer(s)
they plan to purchase from the Seller, establishing a direct connection with 
an `SSN`, and broadcasting their intent to purchase.

#### Fulfillment API 
This is the stage where the Seller processes the order, 
packages the product(s), and, if applicable, ships them to the Buyerâ€™s specified
delivery address. Order fulfillment broadly represents the event when a 
Buyer receives the Item(s) from a Seller and can, optionally, 
be represented by a delivery.

#### Post-fulfillment API
This is the stage where the Buyer receives the 
Item(s), and inspects the Item(s). In this stage, the Buyer may provide 
feedback, require customer support, or initiate a return/refund if 
dissatisfied.

## Testing 
When editing, test to ensure schemas are validd by running the following command in your terminal:
```sh
swagger-cli bundle postman/schemas/index.yaml --outfile api/api.yaml --type yaml
```
