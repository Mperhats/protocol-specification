description: Provides an overview to a receiving node with information about the intended transaction. Typically, a Buyer Supporting Node (BSN) sets the context based on the consumers location and search. Context includes - <ol><li>Demographic information like `industry`, `country`, and `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and receiving Node's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol version</li><li>Transaction details like the receiving Nodes call method, the transaction_id of a Buyer Supporting Node (BSN) session, an encryption key, a message ID to pair with API calls between Nodes, a ttl, and a timestamp</li></ol> This object must be passed in every interaction between a Seller Supporting Node (SSN) and a Buyer Supporting Node (BSN)

  message_id:
    description: "This is a uid used to persist across a communication cycle (request / callback). The Universal Transaction Protocol APIs are asynchronous so Buyer Supporting Node (BSN)'s require a persistent uid to match incoming Seller Supporting Node (SSN) callbacks to previous callbacks. The uid can be used to ignore duplicate messages.  message_id's should be initiated for every new interaction. If a Seller Supporting Node (BSN) is responding with unsolicited callbacks, they must initiate a new message_id."
